# Loot Generator Application

The idea of this application is to serve as a library and a frontend to add new loot into a game.

Ideally some configuration will be available for the loot, but the level of configuration may vary during dev.
Some degree of enforcement has to be applied for the loot rules

This will be written in Java using Spring + Hibernate/MySQL + Thymleaf (Maybe Angular/React later)
Additionally HTML/Javascript and CSS will be used for frontend elements.
